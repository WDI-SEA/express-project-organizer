Requirements

Part 1: Create a Category model
In order to add categories, create a Sequelize model to store categories. It's recommended that you name this model category. It will store one attribute: the name of the category (a string).


sequelize model:create --name category --attributes name:string

sequelize model:create --name categoriesProjects --attributes categoryId:integer,projectId:integer
